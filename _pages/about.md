I am a fourth-year PhD student in the [Center for Research in Computer Vision](https://www.crcv.ucf.edu) at the [University of Central Florida](https://www.ucf.edu). My advisor is Dr. Mubarak Shah. I received my Bachelor's Degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics from the University of Central Florida in 2016. 

My research interests lie in the intersection of computer vision and deep learning. Specifically, my research focuses on applying capsule networks to various video related tasks like video action detection, video object segmentation, and text-based video segmentation.
